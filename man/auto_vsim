auto_vsim \- simulazioni automatiche in modelsim
.SH SYNOPSIS
auto_vsim -f file.do
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program needs to automatize debugging process of a digital circuit described in vhdl/verilog through modelsim, in fact given a file.do this program execute it in modelsim without open GUI. It is extremly useful for testbench simulation in which we are interested in output file of dut.
