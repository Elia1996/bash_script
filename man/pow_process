.SH NAME
pow_process \- calculation of switching activity
.SH SYNOPSIS
pow_process -f power_file -s signal1,signal2.. [OPTION]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pow_process elaborate a switching file and 
calculate switching activity of signals printing it to
stdout and in a file.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\-name\fR
filename of power file, it could have a .txt extention or not.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR
signal name, this should be also a sequence of signal. The program search given signals in power file and process only these signal's switching activity. Example: "pow_process -f file.txt -s dout" evaluate dout ESW but if dout is a vector evaluate ESW of each element. Example: "pow_process -f file.txt -s dout,din" evaluate both dout and din ESW.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clk\fR 	("CK" by default)
clock name, this option specifies clock name and is optional, by default clock name is "CK" so if no clock name is given the default clock name is serced for.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-processed\-end\fR		 ("-proc" by default)
this parameter is the string added at the end of power filename to generate filename of output file that contains ESW
.SH ABBREVIATION
Abbreviations of name in output of program
.TP
\fBTtot\fR
Total time of simulation
.TP
\fBTc\fR
Total commutation of signal during simulation
.TP
\fBT1\fR
Total time in which signal ramained at 1
.TP
\fBT0\fR
Total time in which signal ramained at 1
.TP
\fBP1\fR
Probability that the signal is at 1
.TP
\fBP0\fR
Probability that the signal is at 1
.TP
\fBESW\fR
is the switching activity of a signal, in this program is calculated as the ratio between all commutation of signal and clock commutation
